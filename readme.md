# Overview Project name :Live Chat

In this project, I will make live chat by using AWS. I am not understanding what is AWS, but my research shows I can use API gateway and lambda to implement cloud data base functional programming. After that by using video format, I will implement website wise live chat application which allow users to talk on time both public and private.

This is the programmings which I made
1. People can connect the same chat group
2. Their conversation is live, people can share their conversation on same time
3. There are public and Private conversation mode.
